NOTE: Items with the "=" bullet are more likely to be realized in the near future

User interface
= Let key "*" of DOMAIN refer to the first defined MATERIAL_NAME and set this as default 
- 3D plotting (matplotlib or MayaVi)
- GUI with Qt

Numerical model
= visibility of beam
- general visibility of point pairs
- calculate flux through segments and interpolate to nodes (?)
- adaptive grid resolving redeposition/non-local sputtering flux

Higher order surface advancement algorithm
= fully integrate in PyTopSim (use common features)
- compare with angle-bisector and back-interpolation model
- assess gain in computational efficiency

New features
= numerically defined angular and spatial distribution of beam
= multiple materials
- cylinder symmetry
- gas flow model
- periodic "boundary conditions"

Inverse Modeling
- subsequent box mills
- variable dwell time (same for all passes)
- variable dwell time (intermediate surfaces specified)
- hierarchical approach using local relationships of dwell times of neighboring pixels

2D/3D models based on Monte Carlo results 
- generate more tables (Ga, Ar, different energies) for yield and angular dependence of 
  sputtered atoms, and yield and angular dependence of backscattered ions
- consider implanted ions (dynamic equilibrium)
- spatial distribution of sputtered atoms (i.e. nonlocal sputtering model) 

Etching/deposition with precursor diffusion
- Fix bug in 3D precursor diffusion
- Testing (compare with analytical solution, ...)
- Take change of cell area into account
- continuity of precursor in elements *between* nodes instead of *at* nodes (?) 

Experimental verification:
- Kim
- Diss Christoph
- Circular holes (photonic crystals)
- our milled/etched 2D/3D trenches (Simon)
- verify inverse modeling
