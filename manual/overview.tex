TopSim is a 2D/3D \textbf{Top}ography \textbf{Sim}ulator. The mainapplication in mind are ion beam induced processes such as sputtering and ion beam assistedetching and deposition. While the 3D mode has been tested previously, ithas not been used recently and might be broken. So, at the moment, use 3D atyour own risk.TopSim is written in Python with the numpy extension using severalfunction from scipy. Therefore, execution of TopSim requirespython, numpy, and scipy to be installed. In addition, TopSim includes simplefacilities for displaying intermediate and final surfaces, based on matplotlib.If this feature is used, matplotlib has to be installed as well.The simplest way to run TopSim is to type%\begin{verbatim}	python TopSim.py xxx.cfg\end{verbatim}%in the source directory of TopSim. \texttt{xxx.cfg} is the name of aconfiguration file (replace \texttt{xxx} with an actual file name), which holdsthe input parameter specifications. A more convenient way is to run it from aseparate directory. In that case the path to TopSim has to be specified: %\begin{verbatim}	python path_to_topsim/TopSim.py xxx.cfg\end{verbatim}%To view the results right after the end of the simulation, set the\texttt{DISPLAY\_SURFACE} of the \texttt{Output} section to \texttt{True}. Awindow will open at the end of the simulation, and a short help text will bewritten to the terminal, explaining the meaning of keystrokes you can enterwhen focused on the plot window. The same functionality is provided by the\texttt{plot.py} script, which may be called separately from TopSim like%\begin{verbatim}	python path_to_topsim/plot.py xxx.srf\end{verbatim}%\texttt{xxx.srf} denotes the name of the surface file which has been written bythe TopSim run with the \texttt{xxx.cfg} configuration file. Both the plotfunction of TopSim and \texttt{plot.py} will look for a file\texttt{baseline/xxx.srf} and, if present, plot it with dashed lines forcomparison.This manual is a stub. More documentation is hoped to come. However, we try tokeep the description of the input parameters complete and accurate.
