\begin{keydescription}{\texttt{BACKSCATTER\_ANG\_DIST\_FILES}}
This parameter specifies the filenames of the angular distribution tables for
backscattered ions, i.e. the distribution as a function of incidence and
ejection angle. Actual values of the distribution function are obtained by
interpolation in the tables. Paths relative to the work
directory or the physics/tables directory of the code have to be specified. If a
file is not specified or \texttt{''}, the file name is set to the
\texttt{TABLE\_DIRECTORY} joined with the file name \texttt{'bang.npz'}.
\begin{keytab}
   Type:    \> (character string,) \\
   Default: \> required if corresponding \texttt{TABLE\_DIRECTORY} is
               undefined \\ 
\end{keytab}
\end{keydescription}

\begin{keydescription}{\texttt{BACKSCATTER\_YIELD\_FILES}}
This parameter specifies the filenames of the backscatter yield tables,
i.e. the backscatter yields as a function of incidence angle. Actual backscatter 
yields are obtained by interpolation in the tables. Paths relative to the work
directory or the physics/tables directory of the code have to be specified. If a
file is not specified or \texttt{''}, the file name is set to the
\texttt{TABLE\_DIRECTORY} joined with the file name \texttt{'byield.npz'}.
\begin{keytab}
   Type:    \> (character string,) \\
   Default: \> required if corresponding \texttt{TABLE\_DIRECTORY} is
               undefined
\end{keytab}
\end{keydescription}

\begin{keydescription}{\texttt{DENSITIES}}
This parameter specifies the atomic density for each material region. If less
\texttt{DENSITIES} are specified than \texttt{MATERIAL\_NAMES}, the missing
\texttt{DENSITIES} are assumed to be indentical to the last specified
\texttt{DENSITY}. The units of \texttt{DENSITIES} are atoms per nm$^3$.
\begin{keytab}
   Type:    \> tuple of real \\
   Default: \> \texttt{(49.94,)}
\end{keytab}
\end{keydescription}

\begin{keydescription}{\texttt{MATERIAL\_NAMES}}
This parameter specifies the material name for each region. 
\begin{keytab}
   Type:    \> tuple of character string \\
   Default: \> \texttt{('Si',)}
\end{keytab}
\end{keydescription}

\begin{keydescription}{\texttt{SPUTTER\_ANG\_DIST\_FILES}}
This parameter specifies the filenames of the angular distribution tables for
sputtered atoms, i.e. the distribution as a function of incidence and
ejection angle. Actual values of the distribution function are obtained by
interpolation in the tables. Paths relative to the work
directory or the physics/tables directory of the code have to be specified. If a
\texttt{SPUTTER\_ANG\_DIST\_FILE} is not specified or \texttt{''} and , the file
name is set to the \texttt{TABLE\_DIRECTORY} joined with the file
name \texttt{'sang.npz'}. If both \texttt{SPUTTER\_ANG\_DIST\_FILE=''} and
\texttt{TABLE\_DIRECTORY=''}, a cosine distribution function is used.
\begin{keytab}
   Type:    \> (character string,) \\
   Default: \> required if corresponding \texttt{TABLE\_DIRECTORY} is
			   undefined 
\end{keytab}
\end{keydescription}

\begin{keydescription}{\texttt{SPUTTER\_YIELD\_FILES}}
This parameter specifies the filenames of the sputter yield tables, i.e. the
sputter yields as a function of incidence angle. Actual sputter yields are
obtained by interpolation in the tables. Paths relative to the work
directory or the physics/tables directory of the code have to be specified. If a
file is not specified or \texttt{''}, the file name is set to the table directory
joined with the file name \texttt{'syield.npz'}.
\begin{keytab} 
   Type:    \> (character string,) \\
   Default: \> required if corresponding \texttt{TABLE\_DIRECTORY} is
   			   undefined \\ 
\end{keytab}
\end{keydescription}

\begin{keydescription}{\texttt{TABLE\_DIRECTORIES}}
This parameter specifies the directories for the sputter/backscatter
yield/angular distribution tables. Paths relative to the work directory or the
physics/tables directory of the code have to be specified. It is only used, if
the corresponding table file is unspecified. If less \texttt{TABLE\_DIRECTORIES}
are specified than  \texttt{MATERIAL\_NAMES}, the missing
\texttt{TABLE\_DIRECTORIES} are  assumed to be indentical to the last specified
\texttt{TABLE\_DIRECTORY}. 
\begin{keytab}
   Type:    \> (character string,) \\
   Default: \> \texttt{'',}
\end{keytab}
