The configuration file \texttt{xxx.cfg} is read using Python's \texttt{ConfigParser} module. The syntax therefore has to adhere to the \texttt{ConfigParser} rules, which basically demand the configuration fileto be written in the Windows INI format, like%\begin{verbatim}   # A comment   [section1]   option1 = value1   option2 = value2   [section2]   option1 = value3   option3 = value4   ...   \end{verbatim}%Note that same option names appearing in different sections will bedistinguished.One pitfall that requires attention when writing a configuration file is thatTopSim will check the type of the option values against its defaults. SincePython distinguishes between tuples (lists) and scalar values, it is essentialthat tuples are specified as tuples and scalars (e.g. floats) as scalars(floats). A tuple parameter can be specified as%\begin{verbatim}   option = (item1,item2,...,itemn)\end{verbatim}%with the dots replaced by other item values. The parenthesis may beomitted, but the commas are essential. Several TopSim parameters are tuples,among them parameters that have components in x- and y-direction. While in a 2Dsimulation only the x-component is used, the parameter still is a tuple and mustbe specified as a tuple like%\begin{verbatim}   option = item1,\end{verbatim}%Incomplete tuples will have their missing elements duplicated from the lastgiven component. If in doubt, consult the \texttt{[Output]LOG\_FILE}, where acopy of all parameters after any substitutions can be found.
